# SFT-vanilla-ResNet
This repository contains code for surgically fine-tuning and evaluating an ImageNet-trained ResNet-50 on a data set called Stylized-ImageNet.

Project Motivation:

As society is increasingly finding more novel applications for Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) - applications for which there’s a high price to pay for incorrectly
classifying images (e.g. autonomous cars and cancer-detection) - it is important to ensure
that these models use the same classification strategies as humans. In this work, we
show that this can be achieved by fine-tuning an ImageNet-trained ResNet-50 on a data
set called Stylized-ImageNet and using a novel fine-tuning technique called ‘surgical fine-tuning’.
